# NYC-Covid-Analysis
-- COVID-19 impact analysis based on OEM emergency notifications.
  
This is the final project of NYU CS-GY 6513 Big Data Spring 2020 course.  
  
The purpose of this project is to find out whether the COVID-19 epidemic has any impact of the number of 
emergencies in different classifications happening in NYC so that we may find out in which way the epidemic 
affects people life most in the city.

We will select data from year 2019 to 2020, check out whether thereâ€™s fluctuations during the virus breakout.
